# Marathon

## node apps, playing nice

Marathon manages your Node.js application servers to get you up and running quickly. No more starting and stopping servers in your development environment. No more managing application port numbers. No more http://localhost:3000. Just a straightforward web interface, and clean, simple URLs.


## installation

    $ npm install marathon

During installation, you'll need to answer a couple quick questions about how you want your files setup. After that, it's free and clear. Marathon will automatically start in the background each time you start your computer.
